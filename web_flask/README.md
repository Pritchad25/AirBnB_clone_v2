## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement a web framework using Flask.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- What is a Web Framework
- How to build a web framework with Flask
- How to define routes in Flask
- What is a route
- How to handle variables in a route
- What is a template
- How to create a HTML response in Flask by using a template
- How to create a dynamic template (loops, conditions…)
- How to display in HTML data from a MySQL database

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
### Python Scripts <a name="python-scripts"></a>
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
